\title{Download monthly prism data}
\usage{
get_prism_monthlys(type, years = NULL, mon = NULL, keepZip = TRUE,
  keep_pre81_months = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of data to download, must be "ppt", "tmean", "tmin",
"tmax", "tdmean", "vpdmin", or "vpdmax". Note that \code{tmean == mean(tmin, tmax)}.}

\item{years}{a valid numeric year, or vector of years, to download data for.
If no month is specified, year averages for that year will be downloaded.}

\item{mon}{a valid numeric month, or vector of months.}

\item{keepZip}{if \code{TRUE}, leave the downloaded zip files in your
'prism.path', if \code{FALSE}, they will be deleted.}

\item{keep_pre81_months}{The pre-1981 data includes all monthly data and the
annual data for the specified year. If you need annual and monthly data it
is advantageous to keep all the monthly data when downloading the annual
data so you don't have to download the zip file again. When downloading
annual data, this defaults to \code{FALSE}. When downloading monthly data, this
defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Download monthly data from the prism project at 4km grid cell resolution for
precipitation, mean, min, and max temperature
}
\details{
Data is available from 1891 until 2014, however you have to download
all data for years prior to 1981.
Therefore if you enter a vector of years that bounds 1981,
you will automatically download all data for all years in the vector.
If the "all" parameter is set to TRUE, it will override any mon
entered and download all data. Data will be downloaded for all mon
in all the years in the vectors supplied. You must make sure
that you have set up a valid download directory.
This must be set as options(prism.path = "YOURPATH")
